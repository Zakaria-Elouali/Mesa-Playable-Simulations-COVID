Today I want to follow up with something I've been working on: playable simulations of a disease. 
"Playable" means you'll get to tweak parameters (like transmission and mortality rates) and watch how the epidemic unfolds.
### This is not an attempt to model COVID-19.
What follows is a simplified model of a disease process. The goal is to learn how epidemics unfold in general.
here the full-Model in initial state:

### After run few step:

- Also we have many spiciefic Model like [Recovery, Incubation period, Probabilistic infection, Travel, ...]
