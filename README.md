Today I want to follow up with something I've been working on: playable simulations of a disease. 
"Playable" means you'll get to tweak parameters (like transmission and mortality rates) and watch how the epidemic unfolds.
This is not an attempt to model COVID-19.
What follows is a simplified model of a disease process. The goal is to learn how epidemics unfold in general.
